        Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is <strong>Sarthak Hota</strong>, and I am an enthusiastic and
        detail-oriented software developer based in <strong>New Delhi, India</strong>.I specialize in building robust,
        scalable, and user-friendly applications using a wide range of modern technologies. With a strong foundation in
        <strong>Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL</strong>, I am passionate about backend development. At the
        same time, I enjoy creating interactive and visually appealing interfaces using <strong>HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript</strong>.

        From a young age, I have always been fascinated by technology and the impact it can have on the world. This
        curiosity led me to explore software development, where I found a perfect combination of logic, creativity, and
        problem-solving. I have since dedicated myself to learning and mastering tools and frameworks that help bring
        ideas to life. For me, coding is not just about writing lines of code â€” it's about building experiences that
        matter.<br><br>

        I have worked on several real-world projects that showcase my skills and my commitment to quality development.
        These include a <strong>Face Recognition System using Python</strong>, an interactive <strong>Quiz
          Website</strong> built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a <strong>custom Chrome Extension</strong>
        designed to improve user experience on the web. Each project taught me valuable lessons about user needs, clean
        code practices, and UI/UX design.<br><br>

        I am a self-motivated learner who constantly strives to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the
        software development world. Currently, I am exploring advanced topics like <strong>RESTful APIs, React.js,
          Node.js, and cloud deployment</strong> to become a full-stack developer capable of handling end-to-end project
        development. I enjoy diving deep into new concepts, watching tutorials, reading documentation, and applying my
        knowledge through hands-on coding.<br><br>

        I am also passionate about building strong professional relationships and collaborating with others. I believe
        that great software is built by great teams, and I am always open to teamwork, feedback, and continuous
        improvement. Whether itâ€™s a college group project or a professional collaboration, I bring dedication,
        discipline, and a growth mindset to the table.<br><br>

        My goal is to secure opportunities where I can apply my knowledge in a real-world setting, contribute to
        impactful projects, and continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving industry. I am currently seeking
        internships, freelance opportunities, or junior developer roles where I can work on challenging problems,
        deliver meaningful results, and be part of something bigger.<br><br>

        This portfolio website is a reflection of my journey so far. It includes a detailed overview of my skills, my
        academic and technical background, and showcases the projects that I have worked on with pride. I have also
        added two mini-apps â€” a <strong>To-Do List App</strong> and an <strong>Amazon-style Product Filter Page</strong>
        â€” to demonstrate my practical understanding of front-end and back-end integration.<br><br>

        Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. I truly appreciate your interest in my work. If you think
        Iâ€™d be a good fit for your team, have a project in mind, or just want to say hello â€” feel free to reach out to
        me via email. Iâ€™m always excited to connect, collaborate, and code something amazing together!
